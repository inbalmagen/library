# Library Management System

This is a simple library management system implemented in Python using Flask, SQLAlchemy, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Description

The project aims to create a system for managing a library's books, customers, and loans. It utilizes a SQLite database with three tables: Books, Customers, and Loans.

### Database Tables

1. **Books**
   - Id (Primary Key)
   - Name
   - Author
   - Year Published
   - Type (1/2/3)

2. **Customers**
   - Id (Primary Key)
   - Name
   - City
   - Age

3. **Loans**
   - CustID (Foreign Key referencing Customers.Id)
   - BookID (Foreign Key referencing Books.Id)
   - Loandate
   - Returndate

### Book Types and Loan Duration

- Type 1: up to 10 days
- Type 2: up to 5 days
- Type 3: up to 2 days

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure with separate modules for each entity (Books, Customers, Loans) and their respective classes. The Data Access Layer (DAL) is responsible for interacting with the database.

### Module Structure

- `books.py`: Contains the `Book` class and methods for interacting with the Books table.
- `customers.py`: Contains the `Customer` class and methods for interacting with the Customers table.
- `loans.py`: Contains the `Loan` class and methods for interacting with the Loans table.

## HTML Templates

The project includes HTML templates for the different pages of the library management system. These templates define the structure and layout of the user interface and incorporate Bootstrap for styling. JavaScript code is used for interactivity, such as handling form submissions and updating data dynamically.

- `base.html`: The base template that provides the common structure for all pages. It includes a navigation bar and a content section where page-specific content is rendered.
- `books.html`: The template for the Books page, where you can view, add, edit, and delete books.
- `customers.html`: The template for the Customers page, where you can manage customer records.
- `loans.html`: The template for the Loans page, where you can track loans and returns of books.

These templates work together with the backend logic implemented in Python to create a functional and user-friendly library management system.

## Static Files

The project includes the following static files that are used by the HTML templates:

- `navbar.html`: This file contains the HTML code for the navigation bar, which is included in the `base.html` template. It provides a consistent navigation menu across all pages.

- `table.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for the data table used in the Customers page. It defines the appearance and layout of the table elements.

- `table.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for handling interactivity in the Customers page. It includes functions for adding, editing, and deleting customer records, as well as searching and updating the table dynamically.

These static files enhance the functionality and appearance of the library management system by providing reusable components and custom styles.

## JSON Data

The library management system uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for storing and exchanging data. JSON is a lightweight data format that is easy to read and write for both humans and machines.

The following features of the system involve JSON:

- **API Endpoints:** The server-side API endpoints accept and return data in JSON format. This allows the web application to communicate with the server and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books, customers, and loans.

- **Data Persistence:** The system uses JSON files or a JSON-based database to persist the library data. This ensures that the data remains intact even after restarting the server or the application.

- **AJAX Requests:** The client-side JavaScript code makes AJAX requests to the server API endpoints to retrieve and send JSON data. This enables seamless data updates and real-time interaction with the library database.

By utilizing JSON, the library management system achieves a flexible and efficient data exchange mechanism, making it easier to manage and manipulate library records.


### Unit Tests

The project includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionality. The unit tests cover the various methods in the DAL classes.

## Deployment
